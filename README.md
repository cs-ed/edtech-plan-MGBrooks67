# Educational Technology Plan

Provide a brief description of the purpose of your educational technology Plan

## Context

### Course

  **Course Title:**  Introduction to Computer Science

   **Grade Level:**  9th - 12th

   **Graduation 
      Req Area:**  Elective

**Length/Credits:**  1 Semester/5.0 credits

 **Prerequisites:**  C or better in Math C/8th grade Math/Pre-Algebra
 
 **Course Rationale and Description:**  
* **Who is this course for?**
The Introduction to Computer Science (Intro to CS) course doesn't require any prior computer science knowledge in order to be successful. Simply an interest in computer science and willingness to learn about ‘the mysteries of computers’. Intro to CS is meant to be a semester-long learning experience to explore interest in computer science as a whole. The overall speed of the course is slowed down with a reduction in content to emphasize letting students learn and explore these fundamental concepts at a pace that works best for them. 

* **Rationale:** 
Computer science education can and should be available to all students. With a world that is continuing toward a reliance on computers and other computer related peripherals, computer science education is quickly cementing itself as a core part of a student's foundational learning. Prioritizing computer science in the K12 curriculum helps students to develop critical thinking, problem solving, collaboration and logical reasoning skills that they can later apply in their lives in meaningful and relevant ways. In addition to non-academic applications, computer science has relevance toward a student’s aspiration toward higher education. When implemented correctly, computer science can potentially count as a third year of science credit, fourth year of math credit, a general elective credit, career technical education credit, and or a dual enrollment course (master’s degree dependent). Computer science is highly versatile, being able to satisfy many high school graduation requirements and many university eligibility requirements, incentivizing a diverse population of students to enroll.  Data suggests that early exposure to computer science has long term-term effects on the future college and career choices students make. Clearly, the versatility and long-term influence computer science has on current and future students' overall success advocates for the importance of adopting computer science curriculum and standards as soon as possible.

* **Description:**
Introduction to Computer Science (Intro to CS) introduces students to the foundational concepts of computer science and explores the impact computing and technology have on our society. There are no official prerequisites (C or better is Math C/8th grade Math/Pre-Algebra recommended) and the course is meant to be a first-time introduction to computer science, but students should be comfortable with functions and function notation. Intro to CS is a semester-long high school curriculum that fully aligns to the K12 California State Computer Science Standards and Standards Framework as specified by California State Board of Education. In addition, the CodeHS platform (and related courses) are well aligned with Common Core Math Standards and Next Generation Science Standards most notably. The course is highly visual, dynamic, and interactive, making it engaging for new coders. The lessons and materials used throughout this curriculum incorporate Project-Based Learning (PBL), a pedagogical approach that actively engages students in the educational process, improves retention, and develops problem-solving, critical-thinking, and group communication skills. Through this collaborative, learner-centric approach, students are encouraged to explore the advantages and societal impact of computational technology while developing their own programming and computational thinking skills.

Learning Environment:
The course utilizes a blended classroom approach. The content is a mix of web-based and physical activities. Students will write and run code in the browser, create websites and digital artifacts, and engage in in-person collaborative exercises with classmates. Teachers utilize tools and resources provided by CodeHS to leverage time in the classroom, complexity of assigned tasks and give focused 1-on-1 attention to students. Each unit of the course is broken down into lessons. Lessons consist of video tutorials, short quizzes, example programs to explore, written programming exercises, free response exercises, collaborative creation projects, and research projects.

California Computer Science (Intro to Computer Science) curriculum from CodeHS allows for educators to implement both Project-Based Learning (PBL) and Culturally Responsive Education (CRE) pedagogical techniques in order to better engage students in the learning process. By encouraging students to use critical thinking skills and challenging them to solve authentic and meaningful problems, PBL helps students to develop a deeper and more profound understanding of the power of computation in our everyday lives. This project-based approach is particularly effective in engaging girls and other historically underrepresented groups as well as broadening participation in computing overall. Teachers who are unfamiliar with the goals, methods, and techniques of PBL can learn more at the Buck Institute for Education website. Likewise, more information about CRE can be found at the Education Alliance website. In teaching this curriculum, educators are encouraged to utilize the range of PBL and CRE techniques that have been incorporated into each unit, including driving questions, overarching unit projects, clear rubrics, regular benchmarks, scaffolding activities, final products, and reflection. Used together in a coherent, unified manner that actively engages students in the educational process, PBL and CRE strategies can help students improve their retention of learned experiences and develop stronger problem solving, critical thinking, and group communication skills.

Each unit ends with a comprehensive unit test that assesses student’s mastery of the material from that unit as well as challenge problems where students can display their understanding of the material.


### Situation

Provide relevant details about your course and/or school that will influence the
decisions in the plan. What assets and constraints do you face? What is the
context of your class, considering demographic and technical resources?

I teach at Pleasant Valley High School here in Chico, and we currently do not offer any computer science classes. We are in the process of moving to a block schedule (students can take 8 classes a semester compared to the 6 classes they could take with the traditional schedule). This opens room for new classes and new areas of study. This class is designed as an elective class, open to all students on campus, as a means of introducing them to Computer Science and hopfully sparking enough interest that we could expand our offerings in the future. This class, therefore, is intended to be a bit less technical, more accessible. As we were designing this class, our administration asked if we could make it a semester class instead of a year long class, to better fit in the electives schedule at our school.

**ASSETS:** Our district is a one-to-one district, meaninig that each student is issued a Chromebook to use in all of their classes. So each student will have access to a computer to use for this class both in class and at home. This ensures a level of equity that opens this class to a wider group of students. The Chromebooks are managed and maintained by the IT Department of the district, so that is one less thing the teacher has to worry about. Our site Principal and Vice-Principals have been supportive of the idea of bringing Computer Science classes to our campus, which has made the process of submitting the course to the district for approval much easier than it might have otherwise been.

**CONSTRAINTS:** Our district is a one-to-one district, meaning each student is issued a Chromebook to use in all of their classes. This means that we must design the class to function on Chromebooks. The class, therfore, will be primarily web based for both content delivery and projects. The Chromebooks are managed and maintained by the district's IT Department. The IT Department must be involved in the design of the course to make sure that any web based resources we use meet the required standards for safety and security with regards to student use.

**CONTEXT:** This class will be an introductory elective class. As such, I would expect it to draw a wide range of students who are at least somewhat interested in Computer Science. This means that we will need to differentate material and lessons for students who need more support and also for students who want more of a challenge.

## Plan
